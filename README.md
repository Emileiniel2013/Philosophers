# Philosophers
A program about threads, mutexes and data races


Subject: https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/135133/en.subject.pdf

This is my intepretation of the philosophers problem is C. A program about philosophers sharing resources between them to survive.
My code unfortunately is not the cleanest because I was just putting all the functions in the same c files wihout any logic or organizing so I am sorry about that, but the code is correct, everything is working as it should so be sure to take a look. 

Thanks
